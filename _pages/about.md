I am a Senior NLP Researcher at Tencent AI Lab, Seattle. My primary research interest lies in large language models (LLMs), multimodal foundation models, and how to leverage these models to build autonomous AI agents that can memorize, reason and learn. In particular, I develop [generalist agent systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10277) that can complete real-world tasks, and build large [vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01744) that can support digital agents. I also work on topics such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reasoning and planning and model alignment. 

I completed my Ph.D. at Language Technologies Institue at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Eric Nyberg](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/). My thesis focuses on topics including question answering, information retrieval and commonsense reasoning. Specifically, I developed methods that can effectively leverage both explicit knowledge (e.g. text corpus, web tables, knowledge graphs) and implicit knowledge (e.g. model parameters learned from pretraining) for solving challenging reasoning tasks. During my PhD at CMU, I also work closely with [Alessandro Oltramari](https://www.bosch.com/research/know-how/research-experts/alessandro-oltramari-ph-d/) and [Jonathan Francis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7CLS0LwAAAAJ&hl=en) from Bosch Research, [Filip Ilievski](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/ilievski/) from University of Southern California, and [Hao Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/hcheng2site) from Microsoft Research. Before coming to CMU, I obtained my B.S/M.S degree in computer science from Emory University, working with [Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi).
