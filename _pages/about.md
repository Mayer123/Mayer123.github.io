I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Language Technologies Institue, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Eric Nyberg](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/). I also work closely with [Alessandro Oltramari](https://www.bosch.com/research/know-how/research-experts/alessandro-oltramari-ph-d/) and [Jonathan Francis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7CLS0LwAAAAJ&hl=en) from Bosch Research, [Filip Ilievski](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/ilievski/) from University of Southern California, and [Hao Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/hcheng2site) from Microsoft Research. Before coming to CMU, I obtained my B.S/M.S degree in computer science from Emory University, working with [Prof. Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi). 

My primary research interest lies in question answering, commonsense reasoning and natural language understanding. Specifically, I'm interested in developing methods that can effectively leverage both explicit knowledge (e.g. text corpus, web tables, knowledge graphs) and implicit knowledge (e.g. model parameters learned from pretraining) for solving challenging reasoning tasks.
