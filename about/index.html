			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I have taken many interesting courses at Emory, including Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Operating System, Compiler Construction, System Programming, Algorithms and Data Structure etc. I worked on several intriguing course projects and you can find them in my <a href="https://github.com/Mayer123">Github Repository.</a></p>
			<p>I joined Emory Natural Language Processing Lab in spring 2016, and I worked on 2 major projects Speaker Identification and Sentence Completion. You can find more at <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-3009.pdf">Here.</a></p>
			<p>Outside of study and research, I am a rider of Emory Equestrian team. I have competed in intercollege horse show for more than 2 years. I also like traveling and watching movies during my spare time. </a></p>
